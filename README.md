This is intended to become an software engineering metrics importer
for projects on GitHub using the GitHub API.

The test uses these libraries:

- [Dispatch](http://dispatch.databinder.net)
  as an HTTP client for interacting with the server mock.
- [specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2)
  for its nice matchers (especially JSON).
